# monkeylang

Implementation of the toy Monkey language from [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [_Writing a Compiler in Go_](https://compilerbook.com) by [Thorsten Ball](https://github.com/mrnugget).

Plan is to extend this language once I am done going through the books.
